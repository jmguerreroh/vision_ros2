# vision_ros2

This repository provides a collection of basic computer vision examples built with ROS 2, OpenCV, image_transport, message_filters, and the Point Cloud Library (PCL). It is designed as a foundational starting point for developing visual perception modules in robotics, including image and depth processing, multi-sensor synchronization, and 3D scene understanding.
